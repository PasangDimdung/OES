# OES (Online Examination System)

The project focuses on creating an Online Examination System for educational institutions, allowing them to organize, conduct, and manage exams online via the internet or intranet. 
Traditional paper-based exams have numerous drawbacks, such as limited accessibility, lower data quality, inflexibility, lengthy processes, high costs, and environmental impact.

The Online Examination System addresses these issues by being efficient, fast, and resource-saving. It thoroughly evaluates students through an automated process, offering quick and accurate results. Highly customizable exams can be set by department, academic year, semester, subject, and type. The system’s web-based nature facilitates easy access, which could lead to increased cheating; however, it employs a Shuffling Algorithm to prevent this, ensuring that only the admin can generate and view questions, keeping them unknown to teachers and students before the exam.
